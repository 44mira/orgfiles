* Linux
** Window manager (=Hyprland=)
   - Tiling window manager
     - Allows for efficient use of screen space
   - Poweruser-centric key mappings
   - Human-friendly configuration
     - Very nice documentation
** Shell
*** Tooling
    - =zsh=
    - =zoxide=
    - =eza=
    - GNU-Linux binaries
*** =kitty=
    - Multiplexer
    - Terminal graphics protocol 
    - Very tidy configuration
* Neovim
** Terminal-based text editor
   - Yup, this is on the terminal.
** Has a lot of pretty cool keymaps for general text editing
   - Check out my keystrokes! (Top right).
   - speed speed speed speed
** Very extensible
   - Configurable in =Lua= (=and vimscript I guess=).
   - Very rich ecosystem for plugins.
* Developing
** Neovim as an IDE
   - LSPs
     - Completion
     - Diagnostics
   - Treesitter Highlighting
   - Snippets
   - Debugger
   - Copilot support (/exists/)
     - I personally don't use it.
   - Fast directory traversal
   - Paired with a terminal multiplexer (=tmux=, =kitty=)
   - ... all the other tooling I could need
** LazyGit
   - I believe I'm familiar enough with Git to warrant a much more accessible interface
   - I think it contributed a significant speedup and increase in quality to my Git workflow.
     - Line-specific commits
     - Rebases
* Orgmode
** Originally of Emacs fame
   - A Markup language
   - There's a Neovim port!
     - A bit buggy but workable!
** *Zettelkasten* (note box)
   - An orgmode extension, =Org-roam= facilitates this method
   - Notes contain a single idea or concept (*atomic*).
     - stored in a *database*, and linked together.
       - Org-roam allows for interfacing with these links
       - Also provides a neat API for their database!
         - Originally depended on =sqlite=, but the port uses a Lua implementation of the database
   - Capture notes whenever, and add them into the Zettelkasten!
* LaTeX
** Neovim integration with =vimtex= and =LuaSnip=
   - =vimtex= provides a workflow out-of-the-box.
     - This includes compiling, exporting, and cleaning artifacts.
   - =LuaSnip= allows for better writing experience with snippets.
** Thesis!
   - It looks cool
   - Syntax for math and code
