*** Single-user Monolithic Computing
    - Not connected to any network.
    - Used by only one user at a time.
    - Only uses resources within its /immediate/ access.
*** Multi-user Monolithic Computing

      - Accessed through *terminals* (keyboard and monitor)
**** Mainframe Computers
     - Multi-user
     - Multi-programming
     - High performance
** Types of Computer Networks
   1. Personal Area Network (PAN or WPAN)
   2. Body Area Network (BAN)
   3. Local Area Network (LAN)
     - Ethernet (10 Mbps)
     - Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps)
     - Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbps)
     - Wifi
