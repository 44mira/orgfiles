#+TITLE: Data Communications

* Communications Model
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  source -> transmitter -> transmission system -> receiver -> destination
  #+END_QUOTE

** Source
   - Generates data to be transmitted
** Transmitter
   - Converts data to transmittable signals
** Transmission System
   - Carries data
** Receiver
   - Converts received signal into data
** Destination
   - Takes incoming data

* OSI Model
  - /Open Systems Interconnection/
  - An open system but is /not/ a protocol
  - Seven layers
  - [[TCP/IP][TCP/IP]] is the de facto standard
** Layers
*** Application

*** Presentation
*** Session
*** Transport
*** Network
    - Responsible for delivery of individual *packets* from the source host to the destination host.
*** Data Link
    - Responsible for moving *frames*.
    - Node-to-node delivery
    - Transforms the raw transmission into a reliable link
    - Other responsibilities:
      - Framing, physical addressing
      - Flow control, error control, access control
*** Physical
    - Responsible for movement of *bits* from one hop (node) to the next
    - Deals with mechanical and electrical specs of the interface and medium
    - Concerned with the following:
      - Line configuration, topology
      - Transmission mode, transmission medium
      - Interface, signals, encoding
* TCP/IP
  - /Transmission Control Protocol/ / /Internet Protocol/
  - A set of standards that describe how data is to be transferred between computers.
** Layers
*** Application
    - Encompasses OSI Model's [[#osi-application][Application]], [[Presentation]] and [[Session]] layers.
*** Transport (host-to-host)
    - Encompasses OSI Model's [[Session]].
*** Internet
    - Encompasses OSI Model's [[Network]].
*** Network Access
    - Encompasses OSI Model's [[Network]] and [[Data Link]].
*** Physical
    - Encompasses OSI Model's layer of the same name.

* Data Communications System
** Fundamental Characteristics
*** Delivery
    - Deliver data to the correct destination
*** Accuracy
    - Deliver data accurately
*** Timeliness
    - Deliver data in a timely manner

** Data Representations
   - Information comes in different forms
     - Text
     - Numbers
     - Images
     - Audio
     - Video
