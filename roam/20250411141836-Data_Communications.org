#+TITLE: Data Communications

* Communications Model
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  source -> transmitter -> transmission system -> receiver -> destination
  #+END_QUOTE

** Source
   - Generates data to be transmitted
** Transmitter
   - Converts data to transmittable signals
** Transmission System
   - Carries data
** Receiver
   - Converts received signal into data
** Destination
   - Takes incoming data

* OSI Model
  - /Open Systems Interconnection/
  - An open system but is /not/ a protocol
  - Seven layers
  - [[TCP/IP][TCP/IP]] is the de facto standard
** Layers
*** Application
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: osi-application
    :END:
    - To allow access to network resources.
    - Responsible for *providing services* to the user.
*** Presentation
    - To translate encrypt and compress data.
    - Responsible for *translation, compression, and encryption*
    - Concerned with the syntax and semantics of the information exchanged between two systems.
*** Session
    - To establish, manage, and terminate sessions.
    - Responsible for *dialog control and synchronization*
    - *Network dialog controller*
      - Establishes, maintains, and synchronizes the interaction among communcating systems.
*** Transport
    - To provide reliable process-to-process message delivery and error recovery.
    - Responsible for the delivery of a *message* from one /process/ to another.
      - A process is an application program running on a host.
**** Other responsibilities
     - Service-point (port) adressing
     - Segmentation and reassembly
     - Flow control (end to end), error control (process to process)
     - Connection control
*** Network
    - To move packets from source to destination; to provide internetworking.
    - Responsible for delivery of individual *packets* from the source host to the destination host.
    - Source-to-destination delivery of packets can be across multiple networks ([[Data Link][links]]).
**** Other responsibilities:
     - Logical addressing, address transformation
     - Multiplexing
     - Routing
*** Data Link
    - To organize bits into frames; to provide hop-to-hop delivery.
    - Responsible for moving *frames*.
    - Node-to-node delivery
    - Transforms the raw transmission into a reliable link
**** Other responsibilities:
     - Framing, physical addressing
     - Flow control, error control, access control
*** Physical
    - To transmit bits over a medium; to provide mechanical and electrical specifications.
    - Responsible for movement of *bits* from one hop (node) to the next
    - Deals with mechanical and electrical specs of the interface and medium
**** Concerned with the following:
     - Line configuration, topology
     - Transmission mode, transmission medium
     - Interface, signals, encoding
* TCP/IP
  - /Transmission Control Protocol/ / /Internet Protocol/
  - A set of standards that describe how data is to be transferred between computers.
** Layers
*** Application
    - Encompasses OSI Model's [[#osi-application][Application]], [[Presentation]] and [[Session]] layers.
*** Transport (host-to-host)
    - Encompasses OSI Model's [[Session]].
*** Internet
    - Encompasses OSI Model's [[Network]].
*** Network Access
    - Encompasses OSI Model's [[Network]] and [[Data Link]].
*** Physical
    - Encompasses OSI Model's layer of the same name.

* Data Communications System
** Fundamental Characteristics
*** Delivery
    - Deliver data to the correct destination
*** Accuracy
    - Deliver data accurately
*** Timeliness
    - Deliver data in a timely manner

** Data Representations
   - Information comes in different forms
     - Text
     - Numbers
     - Images
     - Audio
     - Video
